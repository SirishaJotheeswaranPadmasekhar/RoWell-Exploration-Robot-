# The RoWell Robot 

## Project Description 
Borewell has been our major source of water since the time of 1990s. We as humans has evolved to find solutions to make use of resources the earth is willing to provide us or maybe even more at sometimes. But are we stuck in a cycle of finding solutions that then become the source of new problems? This project focuses on being an advocate to address the major social-issue that has raised in parts of the world. 

The portmanteau word "RoWell" derived from Robot-Borewell drives way to inculcate robot vision processing and integrate robotic learning to borewell systems. Due to negligence and ignorance, people forget to cover the boreholes after draining underground water and pulling out the pipes. The lack of knowledge remains as the root cause of the problem. The recent statistics states that there are over 37 Million borewells in India and almost 70% of rescue operate fail. The death rate from 2015 to 2021 has accelerated. The objective of the research is to bridge the technological gap by adapting to Deep Learning Based Approach for the Rowell robot to explore any given environment, detect and classify high risk, low risk and safe borewells in real-time and alert the government officials to inspect and raise awareness to people in the community of high and low risk locations. Furthermore, integrating to Maps platforms allows us to locate borewells  in real-time. The current work focuses solely on the quote, "Prevention is better than cure".  

The Rowell  Robot is autonomous and Data-driven. The volatile nature of the environment has raised concerns for its tediousness and lowered precision. The one stage object detection method(s) are used to overcome these restrictions since they employ a single neural network for both detection and classification which is faster and significantly accurate compared to traditional two-way object detection methods.The requirement matrix (reference/requirement matrix.jpg) allows us to evaluate one stage detector algorithms with our metrics. On evaluation Yolov3, yolov5, yolov7, efficientDet and ResNet is the best algorithms for performance evaluation. The algorithms  are comparatively been able to perform the tasks with accuracy and precision, and is cost effective, utilizes wide angle vision to detect small objects and can detect borewells in real-time which allows us to deploy our project with utmost efficiency. 

## Focus

1. G-Chart for Borewell Accidents
